## Contributing Guidelines
1. Add assets such as images and other media in assets folder.
2. Follow standard coding practises, naming conventions and the regular document object model (DOM).
2. Make issues on GitHub to propose new features, bugs and then make a PR referencing the same.
3. It is now mandatory for everyone to comment on every PR made and read other people's code.
4. Write your name in Contributors section below when PR is made.
5. Make sure you update your REMOTE ORIGIN in case you have forked this repo : [Refer](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
6. Once you update the forked repo make sure you rebase the changes and then open the PR. [Refer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository)
7. Every PR should only have one logical change and the least number of commits possible (If for some reasons the commits are higher then the creator of the PR would be asked to squash them.) If he/she doesn't comply, then PR is not to be merged.     
[Refer](https://makandracards.com/makandra/527-squash-several-git-commits-into-a-single-commit
) in case there are multiple commits.
