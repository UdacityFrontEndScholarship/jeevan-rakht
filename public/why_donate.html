        <p><b>Why should we donate blood?</b><br/>
             There are a huge number of people who need blood at any given time and the reasons may vary. 
             People might need blood because:<br/></p>
        <ul>
        <li> The recipient may have been in a road accident, natural disaster, childbirth and lost huge 
        amount of blood in these situations.</li><br/>
        <li> A patient under surgery may need blood in case of sudden loss of blood or any medical 
        complication.</li><br/>
        <li> In case of certain liver ailments like Hepatitis C where there is destruction and 
        regeneration of liver, platelet transfusion may be required.</li><br/>
        <li> In a severe case of anemia, patient may require blood transfusion.</li><br/>
        <li> Cancer patients may require blood transfusion, especially when they are under
        chemotherapy (treatment which affects blood cells) or stem cell transplants. Many 
        chemotherapy medicines and the disease itself can sometimes interfere with normal 
        production of blood cells in the bone marrow.</li><br/>
        <li> Dengue patients may require Platelet transfusion if their platelet count is less than 10,000 
        and they are having active bleeding.</li><br/>
        <li> Thalassemia is a genetic disease, where the patient's body generates less healthy
        hemoglobin and red blood cells, which puts pressure on the bone marrow and spleen. Patients, 
        who are suffering from acute or intermediate level, blood transfusion is the main medical care 
        option.</li><br/>
        <li> Thrombocytopenia is the condition where there is a low platelet count in patient’s body and 
        this may be inherited or acquired later due to several reasons. Patients need blood transfusion 
        to help them maintain the platelet count.</li><br/>
        <li> Hemophilia is a rare disorder where a patient’s blood doesn't clot in normal way. It is an 
        inherited disease and can be treated by replacement therapy where concentration of clotting
        <br/>
        <br/> 
        factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or 
        injected into a vein. Clotting factor concentration can be made of blood though in this case
        concentration which are not made from blood are also available.</li> <br/>
        <li>There are several other diseases and cases where patients may require blood transfusion 
        and we as blood donors hold the power to be a hero and save lives, so please donate blood.</li><br/>
       <b>Why can't the parents, siblings, children and immediate family donate blood when required?
        Why is my donation required?</b><br/>
        When parents, siblings, children, family donate blood it is known as direct donation. This may 
        not be possible/advisable due to a few reasons.
        <br/>
        <li>The blood group may not match. It is possible even in the case of family that the blood group 
        may not match.</li><br/>
        <li>The donations made by family may not be enough for the patient’s needs because a donor can 
        only donate 1 pint.</li><br/>
        <li>Though people may find it safer to have a family member as donor, but research doesn't 
        support this theory. A few reasons for this are that donors known to the patient may be 
        hesitant to reveal information about their personal or medical history. Also, there may be more 
        chances of infection for a first-time donor than a regular donor.</li><br/>
        <li>Previously pregnant women can become sensitized against red cell antigens from their 
        children’s father(s), causing adverse reactions in the transfusion recipient.</li><br/>
        <li>Also even if the family members are compatible it takes some time to test the collected blood 
        to ensure that it is safe for transfusion.</li><br/>
        <li>Women of childbearing age should not be recipients of blood donated by their children, 
        husband or husband’s blood relatives as this could adversely affect future pregnancies should 
        red cell antibodies form.</li><br/>
        <li>Being a regular donor helps you to be available when someone needs your help and helps you to 
        be healthy as you regularly undergo medical checkups.</li><br/>
        <b>Blood supply improves, but India still faces a shortfall of 10 per cent</b><br/>
        Data shows that 16 States (including Union Territories) faced a shortage while 18 States had sufficient 
        or excess amount of blood units.<br/>
        India faced a 10 per cent shortage in its estimated blood requirement in 2015-16, an improvement from 
        the 17 per cent shortfall reported in 2013-14 (as per Govt. records). The estimated requirement is 
        around 1.2 crore units per annum.,<br/>
        In 2015-16, blood collection through various sources, including blood donation camps, was 1.1 crore 
        units — a shortage of 11.5 lakh units, according to data released by the Ministry of Health and Family 
        Welfare. The availability of blood is also sharply skewed. While Delhi had a surplus of 233 per cent in 
        available blood units, Bihar faced 85 per cent shortage — the State had just 1.6 lakh units available 
        against a demand of 10.3 lakh units per annum — the Ministry said in response to a question in 
        Parliament.<br/>
        However, the availability of blood units had improved from 2013-14 when a shortage of 17 per cent was 
        recorded. The shortage was 21 lakh units in 2013-14.<br/>
        Sikkim, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttaranchal and West Bengal moved from a deficit in 2013-14 to a 
        surplus in 2015-16. For instance, Sikkim had a 19 per cent shortage in 2013-14. However, in 2015-16, 
        blood unit availability improved by around 22 percentage points, with a surplus of 2.6 per cent.
        Among the large States, Maharashtra (46 per cent), Punjab (39 per cent) and Kerala (35 per cent) had the 
        highest proportion of excess blood units.<br/>
        At the other extreme, in addition to Bihar, four other States — Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar 
        Pradesh and Meghalaya — had a shortage of greater than 50 per cent. Jammu and Kashmir reduced its 
        blood deficit by 53 percentage points — the highest among large States — down from 85 per cent 
        shortage in 2013-14 to 32 per cent in 2015-16.<br/>
        In response to a Parliament question earlier this year, the Health Ministry noted there was no shortage 
        of blood banks in India. As of February 2015, there were 2,708 — 1024 public and 1684 private — blood 
        banks in the country. However, 81 districts spread across 17 States did not have a blood bank.
        Many of these districts are new and recently created.<br/>
        Under the National Health Mission, for 2015-16, proposals were received from Madhya Pradesh and 
        Assam, requesting support for 11 new blood banks, for which approval had been accorded.
        “Under the National AIDS Control Programme-IV, the government is strengthening the programme 
        for blood transfusion services with efforts directed towards the promotion of voluntary, non-
        remunerative blood donation in partnership with NGOs and voluntary organizations,” the Ministry 
        said.<br/>
        Beware! when you donate blood to any private hospital / clinic they don’t pay you in return, instead 
        some provide complimentary snacks as a social gesture, but do you know that some hospitals sell your 
        donated blood unit as high as Rs. 8,000 to 15,000 taking advantage of the situation. Donate blood to the 
        needy ones. You can join us to know if there is any blood requirement in your vicinity.
